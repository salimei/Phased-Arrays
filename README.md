# Phased-Arrays

Scope : This repository stores all the "back-of-the-envelope" simulations I did during my time at MRT. 

| Name  | Summary |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| MRT_array_1.py | Calculating the array factor AF for equally spaced linear array (ESLA) |
| MRT_antenna_sim.py  | Caculating the link budget and Fresnel zone  |
| MRT_antenna_integration_results.py | Plotting the radiation patterns measured during integration testing |

Here is a more complete description. 

### MRT_array_1.py. 

I implementing the array factor and radiation pattern functions based on the derivations from the following textbook: *Warren L. Stutzman, Gary A. Thiele - Antenna Theory and Design-Wiley (2012)*.


### MRT_antenna_sim.py



### MRT_antenna_integration_results.py
